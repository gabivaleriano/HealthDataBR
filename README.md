# HealthDataBR

This repository contains a collection of 12 real-world datasets carefully assembled for machine learning research and development.

## Overview

These datasets were derived from three distinct healthcare-related databases, resulting in six pairs of train and test sets. All data was collected in Brazil, for the dengue-related datasets, data was gathered across the entire national territory, while for the other datasets, collection was limited to a single city. 

Importantly, these datasets reflect real-world administrative and clinical data, routinely gathered during healthcare operations. They were not curated or cleaned specifically for machine learning tasks, making them particularly valuable for developing and testing algorithms in more realistic, noisy, and challenging environments.

## Clinical Collaboration

A key differentiator of this work is the involvement of a clinician in the preprocessing phase. This collaboration helped guide crucial decisions based on:

   - The nature of each variable.

   - The context of data collection.

   - Clinical relevance and validity.

This domain-expert involvement enhances the reliability, quality, and relevance of the datasets.

## Dataset Details

The file _HealthDataBR.pdf_ contains detailed information about each dataset, including:

   - Preprocessing steps.

   - Summary statistics.

   - Baseline performance of standard machine learning models.

## Usage

We hope this repository proves useful for researchers and practitioners seeking real-world healthcare data to evaluate new machine learning algorithms, fairness techniques, robustness strategies, and more.
